                    The sculptural composition depicts the moment when the Cossack Roga dismounts from his horse near the confluence of the Saksagan
                    River with the Ingulets. The sculptures are made of bronze, and are placed on a pedestal made of a block of iron ore, which
                    was delivered to its destination from the quarry of the ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih enterprise shortly before the opening of the
                    monument. The weight of the pedestal is about 62 tons, and the weight of the sculpture itself is 3 tons. The total height of the
                    monument together with the pedestal is 5 m 30 cm.
